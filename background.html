	<h2 align="center">The SMAC Kids Reading Program</h2>
	<br/>
	<h3>Background and Significance of the Project</h3>
        During the process of getting to know our partnered institution, we observed that the children in our partner community struggles with their reading abilities. It was explained that it was caused due to the late academic development of the children since they weren’t able to attend school and learn when they were supposed to at a young age. Knowing theirconcern, our group was determined to create a solution that will support these children effectively, and that solution is areading program called the “SMAC Kids Reading Program”. It involves the use of active storytelling as an activity.
		<br>Our goal is to improve their literacy skills including their reading, communication, listening abilities, and etc., which are the skills that the children need especially as they develop. It addresses their problem knowing that it gives the children an opportunity to exercise their reading capabilities and therefore improving their ability to learn and understand their lessons and situations more, which they can find useful even after the implementation of our project, and their dreams of graduating too. It correlates with their mission to create and improve programs within the community, and to develop the children into successful spiritually and psychologically mature people. The project also teaches us students to serve thelast, least, and the lost, and lets us apply the basic values we learned as Ateneans, which is to show compassion and to bemen and women for others. This project lets us express that we are willing to show our support and assist our partneredinstitution with their challenges, which makes our projects so important to us. It inspires not only students, but the wholepublic to be aware of issues within communities and reminds them that they are capable of helping and being involveddespite who they are. It helps them become productive citizens that are willing to create solutions and show support incommunal challenges through our project.</br>
		<h3>Problem Identification</h2>
		The SMAC institution has expressed some of the challenges they currently face, one of them is their children’s difficulty with reading and writing. This challenge impacts the children’s literacy skills and ability to comprehend, which is necessary for their studies and development.This challenge concerns the institution’s children and their wellbeing. Our group raises awareness for this need of theirs considering that the SMAC Sisters have a lot to take care of and how they expressed that most of their children are experiencing difficulties with reading, writing, and understanding school lessons. Certainly, this would affect the children’s development since the ability to write and read is needed by the children as they grow, and it may also affect their academic performance (they may struggle). Knowing this, our group wants to help through assisting the institution with their children’s struggles. Like the sisters in the institution, we want their children to attain happiness and live the life they desire, and so we will do what we can to also help them in a way.
        <h3>Proposed Intervention</h3>
		Our solution to the institution’s problem is a reading program that involves active reading. This project makes use of a reading method called “active reading” which means that the children also get to read books aloud, not only us. This project will help boost the children’s reading, vocabulary, and critical thinking skills which will also improve their understanding in their lessons.
Considering how we aim to solve the problem, we make sure that our project has a cause to begin with, we want to help our institution in a way that we are also helping their children. Therefore, we offer them this project that will benefit them. The children will be able to exercise their reading comprehension and vocabulary as they read stories aloud, their listening skills will also be used as they listen to different kinds of stories, and their critical thinking skills as we ask them questions about the stories and what they have learned from it. Not to mention, the children will also be able to develop learnings that influence the way they see different situations from the stories.  We assure them that we are there to guide them throughout the whole program, and to give our best in making it effective and memorable for the children.
This solution is convenient, adaptable and not too difficult to do, it is a project that our group would be able to actually implement, which can be of help to the SMAC Sisters and kids. Our group has access to the resources we need for the project, especially the books for storytelling which we can easily find in bookstores. And this  project/solution will allow us to actually connect and show our willingness to help them with the children’s struggles. 
Without effort, planning, patience, and willingness to understand and help the children, the project will have no use. We would need to be considerate of how the children are and how they feel in order to make the project enjoyable for them. We want to make sure that we are helping them effectively in a way that they are comfortable and happy. To make our project successful, planning is needed to know the flow and how we would deliver and manage our project.
